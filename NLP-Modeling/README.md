# NLP: Modeling

Goal here is to demonstrate how Naive Bayes modeling applies to NLP problems.

## Learning Goals

- Explain the use of Bayesian Reasoning for building NLP models
- Describe Laplace Smoothing
- Use `sklearn` and `nltk` to build NLP models

## Lesson Materials

[Jupyter Notebook: NLP Modeling](nlp_modeling.ipynb)
